    quote: "We were not sure of how things would go in the hall we booked and Ricky managed everything so well that me & Alston didn't have to bother about the flow of events. He first met us a month before the wedding & wanted to know us as a couple. Then he went on to plan the event on paper and we still remember the paper. When me & Alston got to the venue, he ran us thru the flow. Not to miss his dashing suit as all eyes were on him! Beware! He suits up really well! Thankyou so so much Ricky for everything you did at our wedding. We wouldn't have it any other EmCee's way but yours!",

    quote: "Ricky is an amazing emcee! We had him host our wedding early this year and we had an amazing time. People often say, you need a good emcee to keep the crowd going, and there's no one better than Ricky to make that happen. Ricky also has a good sense of humour, which I honestly feel is required at weddings and he knew exactly when to be funny and when to be professional. Highly recommended!",

    quote: "We recently hired Mr. Ricky Sebastian for our engagement function and Sangeet night, and he was undeniably the best host we could have asked for. From the very beginning, Ricky's level of preparation was world-class. He took the time to meet us well before the event to understand our vision and the dynamics of our guest list. He meticulously noted down the names of our close family members and friends, ensuring he could converse with them naturally and personally throughout the night. Ricky was the perfect balance of confident, fun, and impeccably organized. He arrived dressed exactly in line with our party's dress code and kept the audience entertained from start to finish. What truly blew us away was his surprise performance during the Sangeet—it was a personal touch that our guests are still talking about! By the end of the night, it was hard to believe we had only met Ricky once before. He handled the entire event with such care and control that it felt as if a dear friend was at the helm. He didn't just 'work' the event; he took ownership of it from start to end. If you are looking for a host who is brilliantly prepared and adds a genuine heart to your celebrations, Ricky Sebastian is the one.",

Ricky has a natural presence and an incredible ability to read the crowd.

Our guests are still talking about how fun and well-run the reception was, and that's largely thanks to him. If you're looking for an emcee who truly cares about your event, understands the flow of a wedding, and elevates the entire experience, Ricky Sebastian is the one.
